# Coding Quiz
I build a timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions. Using DOM I generated the questions and answer buttons from JS. Everytime you answer incorrect 10 seconds is taken off the time. When you answer all the questions or the time runs out, you are taken to the end screen where you can enter your initials and have your score saved into the high score list. You score being the time remaining on the timer.
